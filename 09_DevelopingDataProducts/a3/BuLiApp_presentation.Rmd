## What does it do?
<img src="bundesliga.png" width="300">

- The app offers the user to research match results of all games played in the German 1. Bundesliga.
- The highest German football leaque was officially founded in 1963, starting its first season in the same year.
- The app is divided in two parts:
1. Search Result function
2. Goals per Season & Team graph tool

## 1. Discover specific results
- Whether you want to know know when the 11:1 of Dortmund against Bielefeld took place, or if there are games that ended 1:9 in history, you can find it on the first tab.
- The analysis tool is applied on a dataset provided by https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata.

- By moving the sliders for home and visiting team goals, the app automatically lists all respective results in history. The results can be ordered according to every information type.
```{r select_result,echo=F}
bl <- read.csv("./BuLiApp/germany_data.csv",header = TRUE,sep = ",")
bl_c <- bl[,1:5];
```

```{r select_result2,echo=T}
homegoal = 1;visgoal = 9;
bl_c[(bl$hgoal == homegoal) & (bl$vgoal == visgoal),]
```

## 2. Goals per saison over Bundeliga history

- Ask yourself, whether there were generally more goals marked per game today or 25 years ago? How did my team behave over time?
- You can plot over time how many goals per season (home/away or all) were marked per saison.
- Select the time span, an individual team (or all teams) and whether you want to compare the data to a trend line (with/without errorbars).

## 2. Goals per saison over Bundeliga history - example for all teams
```{r goal,echo=F,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

bl_g <- bl[,c(2:4,6,7)]

# (h&v) goals per season
s_first <- min(bl_g$Season)
s_last <- max(bl_g$Season)
h <- seq(length(s_first:s_last))
v <- seq(length(s_first:s_last))
for(i in seq(length(s_first:s_last))) {
  h[i] <- sum(bl_g[bl_g$Season == i+s_first-1,]$hgoal)
  v[i] <- sum(bl_g[bl_g$Season == i+s_first-1,]$vgoal)
}
all <- h + v
dat <- data.frame(s_first:s_last, h, v, all)
colnames(dat) <- c("year", "home","visitor","all")

# ggplot2 with loess fit
dat <- gather(dat,key,value,home,visitor,all)
g <- ggplot(dat,aes(x=year, y=value,colour = key)) +
     ylab("goals")+xlab("years")+
     theme(axis.title = element_text(color="black", size=26),
     axis.text  = element_text(vjust=0.5, size=20))
g <- g + geom_point(shape=16, size = 3)
g <- g + geom_smooth(method='loess',se=TRUE)
g <- g + scale_color_manual(values=c("home"="dodgerblue4","visitor"="chartreuse4","all"="orangered2"))+
     theme(legend.text=element_text(size=20),legend.title=element_blank())
g
